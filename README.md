# Sorting-Visualizer
This is a C programs which helps to visualize different sorting techniques in the terminal.
*Note: Currently only works in linux terminals*

To run the program:

`gcc main.c -o main`
And then,
`./main`

Note that the speed of visualization can be changed by changing the sleep() timing in the printArray function.(The value is in microseconds).
The current size of array is 50 , so ensure that the terminal you are using can fit 50 lines to fully visualize the sorting.
